What challenges are you looking to solve for you clients with Generative AI and are you actively engaged in conversations?
Main Usage: 
Main Usage: 
Client Engagement (Keep up with the latest industry news) 

The purpose of this project is to provide a summarization of daily news and market trends. It is hard to keep track of all the market news. 

For example, Bloomberg TV publishes daily news: 
- Bloomberg Daybreak: Australia 03/01/2024 - 45mins
- Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia 03/01/2024 - 48mins
- Bloomberg Markets: The Close 02/29/2024 - 1hr 34mins

It is hard to keep track of everything, but this LLM tool can help summarize 1.5 hours of market news into 5 minutes of reading.
This also applies to understanding the background for the tender project, for example, it is important to understand the energy market while preparing the tender proposal in the coal industry.

Other Usage: 
**Mine site radio analytics**: Provide and analyse transcription for two-way radio. The goal is to ensure on-site truck drivers are following protocol. The metadata can be used for statistical and safety analytics. (Actual client requirement in the past)
**Meeting agenda summarization**: The technology can be extended to use in internal seminar summarization. For example, some colleagues missed KNOWing our Blueprint Series or had no time to watch the series due to working on the billable project. This summarization tool would be handy.

What data or information have you been able to leverage with Generative AI?
The following information and resources have been leveraged in the project.

        1. Bloomberg market news 
        2. Python library: moviepy, 
        3. ML library: OpenAI whisper
        4. OpenAI API Assistant API
        5. .Mp4 video source

Have you delved into any specific Generative AI frameworks or tools? (If applicable, include links to code repositories, videos, or other websites that demonstrate what you've been working on)

This project dived into the OpenAI assistant feature and fine-tuning API, so API calls can provide suitable responses. Furthermore, tools like machine learning library “Whisper” (by OpenAI) and Pytorch (CUDA) are also utilized for the project. 
The development of project 1, GenAI-Video-Summarization, is completed, so please refer to the following information.

        1. Repositories: https://github.com/jjsk-project/GenAI-Video_Summarization.git 
        2. Code: In GitHub repositories.
        3. Demo video: In GitHub repositories.
        4. Flow chart: In GitHub repositories.

Please also look at the project 2, GenAI-Market-Analyst, it is still a work in progress. Please see Github for more info.
